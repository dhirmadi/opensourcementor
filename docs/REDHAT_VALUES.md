# Red Hat Values in Practice

## Open Collaboration
- Share work early and often
- Reuse templates, improve them, and document changes

## Transparency
- Track decisions in issues/PRs
- Keep READMEs and `.env.example` updated

## Community First
- Optimize for team learning and clarity over cleverness
- Favor pairing and write-ups

## Automation
- Containerize steps; prefer scripts over manual actions
- Use Compose for deterministic local runs

## Trust
- Assume positive intent, communicate kindly
- Review code to help others grow
