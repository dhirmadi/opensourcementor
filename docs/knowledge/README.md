# Knowledge Base (docs/knowledge)

Put team-produced know-how here. Suggested structure:

```
docs/knowledge/
├── liteMAAS-tips.md
├── routing-diagram.drawio
├── routing-diagram.png
├── troubleshooting-notes.md
└── rag/
    └── retrieval-ideas.md
```

Guidelines:
- Keep files small and focused
- Add a short intro to each document (purpose, updated date)
- Include source + export for diagrams (`.drawio` + `.png`)
- Do not include secrets or credentials

See `../guides/KNOWLEDGE_GUIDE.md` for accepted formats and tips.
