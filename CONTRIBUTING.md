# Contributing Guide

Welcome! This repository is designed for a one-day hackathon and for future reuse by others. We follow Red Hat values: open collaboration, transparency, community-first, automation, and trust.

## How We Work
- Use issues to propose and discuss changes.
- Use small, frequent pull requests. Reference the issue number.
- Add or update documentation when behavior changes.
- Prefer reusable templates and clear examples over bespoke solutions.

## Code and Config Style
- Podman-first; use `Containerfile` terminology.
- Compose files should be minimal and self-explanatory.
- Keep secrets in environment variables (never commit secrets).
- Use `.env.example` to document required variables.

## Documentation
- Keep READMEs up to date for each team and service.
- Add diagrams or text to `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` as your design evolves.
- Capture decisions in PR descriptions for transparency.

## Documentation formats (knowledge base)
- You may contribute knowledge in multiple formats (Markdown, images, slides, PDFs, notebooks, etc.)
- Place materials under `docs/knowledge/` and see `docs/guides/KNOWLEDGE_GUIDE.md` for tips
- Prefer a short markdown summary alongside binary files

## Conduct
- Be respectful and helpful. Assume positive intent.
- Focus on collective learning and knowledge sharing.
- Prefer pairing and explaining over gatekeeping.

## Getting Help
- Ask mentors for guidance.
- If you’re blocked, open an issue with clear steps to reproduce and what you’ve tried.

Thank you for contributing and modeling open collaboration!
